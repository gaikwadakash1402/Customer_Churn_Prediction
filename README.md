# Customer_Churn_Prediction

# Overview

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict customer churn for a bank. Deep learning models offer the capability to learn complex patterns in the data, which can be beneficial for churn prediction tasks.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about bank customers, including demographics, account activity, transaction history, and churn status.
Approach

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and normalized numerical features.
    Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed the data to make it suitable for input to the deep learning model.
    Model Architecture: Designed a deep learning architecture suitable for customer churn prediction, such as a neural network with multiple layers.
    Model Training: Trained the deep learning model on the preprocessed data.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model using cross-validation and assessed its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Churn Prediction: Used the trained deep learning model to predict customer churn and analyzed the results.

# Results

The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 84%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning for customer churn prediction in the banking domain.
